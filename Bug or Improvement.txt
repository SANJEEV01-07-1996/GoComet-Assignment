Bugs:-

1. When we click on next or previous button in a particular category then item should either show only that category or it     should show no item of that category but it is going to different category. 
2. Sometime when we click on product image instead of product blue link then page is not navigating to description page it     is remains in home page.
3. When we click on product image from product description page, it should again navigate to product description page. but     it is not going anywhere.
4. After adding product to cart, page should navigate to cart page but it remains same.
5. When we click on Place Order, a Log in or Sign Up option should be open but it directly going to address page.
6. No any field of Address page is validated. Means we can add Text in number field and Number in text field like name is     1234 and cradit card number - xxxxxx. so if we add this type of data and try to place order and there should be an error      come but here order is accepting.


Improvement :-

1. There should be a Search field for searching any product.
2. There should be available all view of product like front , back, left, right.
3. There is no way to buy product directly instead of adding into cart. Means there should be a button 'Buy now' beside Add 
     to cart.
4. There should be a counting icon on top of cart icon for showing how many item we have added till now.
5. There should be an option for Increasing the product quantity in cart.
6. There should be a section of my order so that we can check how many order we have ordered.
7.  There sould be a Track option to track order.
